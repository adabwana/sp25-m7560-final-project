This metric of cluster compactness might have been lowered further if nstart was increased. \n\n```r\nfind_kmeanspp_centers <- function(X, K){\n\n  starting_center <- as.matrix(X)[sample(nrow(X), 1),]\n  \n  if (K == 1) {\n    return(matrix(starting_center, nrow = 1))\n    stop\n  }\n  \n  centers <- matrix(NA, nrow = K, ncol = ncol(X), byrow = TRUE)\n  centers[1,] <- starting_center\n  \n  dX <- matrix(rep(starting_center, nrow(X)), nrow = nrow(X), byrow = TRUE)\n  dX <- rowSums((X - dX)^2)\n  probs <- dX/sum(dX)\n  \n  K_ind <- 1\n  while (K > K_ind) {\n    K_ind <- K_ind + 1\n    \n    centers[K_ind,] <- as.matrix(X)[sample(nrow(X), 1, prob = probs),]\n    \n    dC <- sapply(1:K_ind, function(i) {\n      dclust <- matrix(centers[i,], nrow = nrow(X), ncol = ncol(X), byrow = TRUE)\n      rowSums((X - dclust)^2)\n    })\n    \n    mindist <- dC[cbind(1:nrow(dC), max.col(-dC, ties.method = \"random\"))]\n    probs <- mindist/sum(mindist)\n  }\n  \n  return(centers)\n}\n```\n\n```r\nset.seed(7560)\nppcenters <- find_kmeanspp_centers(km, K = 11)\n\n#Sanity check: Are 'pluspluscenters' actual observations?\ncenter_indices <- apply(ppcenters, 1, function(row) {\n  which(apply(km, 1, function(x) all(x == row)))\n})\nisTRUE(all(km[center_indices,] == ppcenters))\n```\n\n```\n## [1] TRUE\n```\n\n```r\nkclustpp <- kmeans(km, centers = ppcenters, nstart = 1)\nplot(km, col = colorset[kclustpp$cluster],\n     main = \"K-means++ Clustering Assignment, K = 11 Clusters\")\npoints(kclustpp$centers, col = \"blue4\", pch = 18, cex = 1.5)\n```\n\n![Kmeans++](../../presentation/images/kmeans/kmeanspp.png)\n\n```r\nsum(kclustpp$withinss)\n```\n\n```\n## [1] 22942.74\n```\n\n```r\nkclustpp$iter\n```\n\n```\n## [1] 8\n```\n\nK-means++ actually performs slightly worse, with a within-cluster sum of squares of `22,942.74` and a total of `8` iterations needed for the k-means algorithm to converge after the starting cluster centers were obtained. Visual inspection of the clusters does not suggest that k-means++ failed, rather it just incidentally produced slightly less compact clusters. Again, the k-means++ algorithm is subject to randomness and a different choice of seed might have yielded better results.\n\nBecause the data set is large and consists of points that lie within a relatively small subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the starting point selection for k-means++, which is based on distance-proportional probability, is close to a random selection of points, because each point's probability of being selected as the next cluster center is almost 0 regardless of the point's distance from the existing cluster centers (for this data set, the average probability of a point being selected as the next cluster is close to `1/nrow(km)` $\\approx$ 0.00018).\n\nThe need for additional iterations in the k-means++ algorithm confirms that the distance-proportional probability selection of initial cluster centers was not especially helpful for clustering this data set; there is no gain in converge speed because the initial cluster centers with the seed used (7560) are not especially good, and the algorithm needs a few more iterations to converge.\n\n```r\nplot(km, col = \"darkgray\", main = \"Initial Cluster Centers for K-means++\")\npoints(ppcenters, col = \"blue4\", pch = 18, cex = 1.5)\n```\n\n![Kmeans
