We focus on two specific prediction challenges: estimating **_visit duration_** and forecasting **_building occupancy_** at the time of check-in. Different modeling approaches were tailored to each task.\n\n## Data Architecture\n\nThe analysis uses LC visit data spanning two academic years. Models were trained on data from Fall 2016 - Spring 2017 and evaluated on a holdout set from Fall 2017 - Spring 2018. Features included student demographics, academic metrics (course load, GPA), temporal information (time of day, week of semester), and external data (weather, lunar phase). An observed bias towards senior-class representation in the data was noted.\n\n## Methodological Framework\n\nWe employed a structured approach using the **R `tidymodels`** ecosystem. Feature engineering was performed using the **`recipes`** package to create informative predictors from raw data, including transformations for temporal features and standardization of numeric variables.\n\nFor both prediction tasks (duration and occupancy), we evaluated several algorithms, including **_Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)_**, **_Random Forest_**, **_XGBoost_**, **_Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)_** networks, and **_Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)_** networks. Hyperparameters for each model were optimized using 5-fold cross-validation specific to the prediction task.\n\n## Implementation Results\n\nModel performance was assessed on the holdout dataset (Fall 2017 - Spring 2018) using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R²).\n\n- **Duration Prediction:** This proved challenging. The best model (XGBoost) achieved an RMSE of 59.9 minutes and an R² of 0.099. Performance was slightly improved by incorporating a weighted average with the training set mean duration.\n- **Occupancy Prediction:** This yielded substantially better results. The optimized XGBoost model achieved an RMSE of 1.83 students and an R² of 0.911, demonstrating strong predictive power.\n\n## Technical Infrastructure\n\nThe project was implemented in **R**, primarily utilizing the **`tidymodels`** suite (**`recipes`**, **`parsnip`**, **`rsample`**, **`tune`**, **`workflows`**, **`yardstick`**). Model implementations relied on `earth` (MARS), `ranger` (Random Forest), and `xgboost` (XGBoost). Standard packages like **`dplyr`**, **`readr`**, and **`ggplot2`** were used for data handling and visualization. External data integration used `lunar` and `openmeteo`.\n\n## Research Findings\n\nPredicting individual visit duration is inherently difficult, likely due to high variability and skewness in usage patterns, resulting in a low R² (0.10). In contrast, predicting building occupancy was highly successful (R² = 0.91). The features and XGBoost model effectively captured the aggregate patterns influencing concurrent LC usage based on check-in data.\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\nFuture work could explore integrating additional environmental factors, applying more complex non-linear or time-series specific models, or developing ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple models to potentially improve performance, particularly for the duration task.\n\n*Implementation details and comprehensive analysis available in associated documentation.*\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Part B: K-means++ Initialization Analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section details a comparative analysis between standard K-means and K-means++ initialization methods for clustering.\n\n## Data & Task\n\nThe analysis was performed on a dataset consisting of $\\sim 5000$ points sampled from a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The objective was to partition this data into $k=11$ distinct clusters.\n\n## Methodology Comparison\n\nWe compared the performance of standard K-means clustering against K-means utilizing the K-means++ initialization strategy. The K-means++ algorithm aims to select more strategic initial centroids to potentially improve clustering quality and convergence speed compared to random initialization.\n\n## Results\n\n- **Standard K-means:** Converged in 5 iterations with a final Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) of 22,824.\n- **K-means++ Initialization:** Converged in 8 iterations with a final WCSS of 22,943.\n\n## Findings\n\nFor this specific $\\mathbb{R}^2$ dataset and $k=11$, the K-means++ initialization method did not demonstrate a discernible advantage over the standard K-means approach, either visually or based on the WCSS metric. The standard method converged faster and achieved a slightly lower WCSS.\n\n*Visualizations and further details available in associated documentation.*\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"background-color:grey;height:2px;width:100%;\"></div>\n```\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div><pre><small><small>source: <a href=\"https://github.com/adabwana/sp25-m7560-final-project/blob/master/src/index.clj\">src/index.clj</a></small></small></pre></div>\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n<style></style><style>.printedClojure .sourceCode {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  border-style: none;\n}\n</style><style>.clay-limit-image-width .clay-image {max-width: 100%}\n.clay-side-by-side .sourceCode {margin: 0}\n.clay-side-by-side {margin: 1em 0}\n</style>\n<script src=\"index_files/md-default0.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script><script src=\"index_files/md-default1.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n\n### Predicting Learning Commons Usage \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n**Fall 2025 | Math 75650 Statistical Learning II | Date: 4/26/25**\n</p>\n\n**By:** Emma Naiyue Liang, Ryan Renken, Jaryt Salvo, & Jason Turk\n\n*************\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">\n**[View our code base on GitHub](https://github.com/adabwana/sp25-m7560-final-project)**\n</p>\n\n# Part A: Learning Commons Prediction\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThis project develops predictive models for student usage patterns at the BGSU Learning Commons (LC).
